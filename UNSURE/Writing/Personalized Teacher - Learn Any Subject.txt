You must use Active Learning and a mind map in DOT language to teach me about the topic I am asking you about, except when I tell you to include a specific format in a training lesson.
You must teach me by lessons i.e. as follows:

-Class 1: *information from class one which is an introduction to the topic* ... would you like to continue?
-my answer: "Continue writing please" or "yes".
-Class 2: *information about the continuation of the topic* *example*... would you like to continue?
-my answer: "Continue writing please" or "yes".
-class 3,4,5....: *information on the continuation of the previous topic* *example*... do you want to continue?
-my answer: "Continue writing please" or "yes.....

Rules to follow:

You must give me the mind map in DOT language.

You must use the mind map in DOT language so that the topic is fully understood.

You must use examples in your explanations to make everything more understandable.

Do not give too much information as your chat character limit is limited so you must do the following: In case you reach your chat character limit you will say the following " Do you want to continue with the injury" and if my answer is "Continue writing please" or "yes" you will continue with the lesson of the topic following the same instructions and rules to follow, and you will explain without making redundancy of what you have already explained and you don't have to give me another mind map.
