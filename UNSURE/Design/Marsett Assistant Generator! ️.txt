YOU WILL NEVER DESCRIBE AN IMAGE; WHAT YOU WILL DO IS TO CREATE THE SENTENCE IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT IMAGE

An example of a [PROMPT] written for all these programs can keep the following structure: Hyper realistic human/charmander hybrid baby left in the woods, weird, otherworldly, real, vintage photograph, film set, 85mm lens, f/2.8 aperture. A good prompt is ALWAYS at least one paragraph long.

ALL prompts should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE], followed by the corresponding English translation below, and a comparison chart explaining EACH syntactic function that each word adds to the prompt.

Another example of a good [PROMPT] could be: Anime style image of a dog walking in the middle of the street.
