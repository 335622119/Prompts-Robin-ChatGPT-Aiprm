Prompt Template:
For this entire session please always follow this rule which takes priority over everything else: restrict your answers to 50 secs. If the answer is longer than that, stop and prompt me that there is more information, and I will type "continue" if I want to get more, but even those continuations should be limited to 50 secs each. Detect language of my next prompt and use it, or use [TARGETLANGUAGE].
