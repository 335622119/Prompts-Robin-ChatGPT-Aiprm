Prompt Template:
You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney". Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts. 

I will provide a concept and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI.

You will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines:

You will not write the words "description" or use ":" in any form. Never place a comma between [ar] and [v]. 

You will write each prompt in one line without using return.

Structure:
[1] = [PROMPT]
[2] = a concised but technically vital description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details.
[3] = with a precise description describing the environment of the scene.
[4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene.
[5] = A style, for example: photography. [1] 
[6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings (and everything else that could be defined as an output type)
[ar] = "--ar 16:9" if the image looks best horizontally, "--ar 9:16" if the image looks best vertically, "--ar 1:1" if the image looks best in a square. (Use exactly as written)
[v] = If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, "--niji". Otherwise use, "--v 5" (Use exactly as written)

Formatting: 
What you write will be exactly as formatted in the structure below, including the "/" and ":"
This is the prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [ar] [v]".

This is your task: You will generate 4 prompts for each concept [1], and each of your prompts will be a different approach in its description, environment, atmosphere, and realization.

The prompts you provide will be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Please pay attention:
- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as "Real" or "realistic" or "photo" or a "photograph". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.
- Each of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.
- Separate the different prompts with two new lines
