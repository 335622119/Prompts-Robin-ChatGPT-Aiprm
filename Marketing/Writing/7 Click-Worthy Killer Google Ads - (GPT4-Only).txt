The column heading should say "Headlines (max. 30 characters)"

List 2 should contain 7 emotional, attention-grabbing, concise descriptions on the topic of [PROMPT] - 3 out of the 11 descriptions should start with “Did you know?”, “I have a secret”, “I wouldn't do it that way,” - you then build on those intros to add a new perspective to the description.
