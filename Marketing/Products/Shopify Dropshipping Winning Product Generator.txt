As a Product Research Specialist with proficient product and market research skills and fluent in [TARGETLANGUAGE], I need you to gather data on unique and attractive products that are not yet available in the market or have the potential to make an impact in people's lives. These products should useful, unique, or have potential for everyday life, and have a low cost of manufacturing, and be able to generate higher margins through dropshipping. Do not use general or common products for this research.
To begin, Write a Heading Title: “Advanced AI Winning Product Research”. The Research has to focus on products that are highly necessary, less competitive, and non-saturated, and that solve a problem in the market. You should look for innovative and useful products from Alibaba, AliExpress, or other Chinese drop shipping providers.

First write the product title as a heading.

	2	Sales Strategies
	3	Keywords to Target
	4	Estimated Audience Size
	5	Marketing Methods/Social Media (Please choose a suitable advertising network from Google Performance Max, TikTok Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, or Pinterest Ads based on the product type and target demographics.)
	6	Suggested Brand Name Ideas
