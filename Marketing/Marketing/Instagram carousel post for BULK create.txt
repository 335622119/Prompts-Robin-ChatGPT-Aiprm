Give a the most eye catching title for the post and add a separator after it.

Write me also slide by slide with titles of a maximum of 5 slides. The titles should not include text like "Slide 1".
Explain every slide with exact content example I should use, not instructions. Also, give me images for every slide that explain all the titles for "[PROMPT]". Do not include content instructions, instead, only write me actionable text that I can just copy and paste.

The slide by slide carousel should be formated as CSV (comma separated values), where every csv value must be surrounded with " and use the first CSV row as the header. This is the CSV header that you should use: "slide1_title","slide1_p1","slide1_p2","slide2_title","slide2_p1","slide2_p2","slide3_title","slide3_p1","slide3_p2","slide4_title","slide4_p1","slide4_p2","slide5_title","slide5_p1","slide5_p2".

After writing the carousel slides, add a separator at the end.

Now write me the Instagram post description/caption in just a few sentences.
Format every new sentence with new lines so the text is more readable.
Include emojis and the best Instagram hashtags for that post.
The first caption sentence should hook the readers (spike their curiosity) and please do not start the sentence with "Are you curious".
