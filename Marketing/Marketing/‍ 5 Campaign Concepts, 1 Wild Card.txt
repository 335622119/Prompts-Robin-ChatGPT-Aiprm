Prompt Template:
I want you to act and write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] as a world-class digital marketing creative and analyst expert and write and create 5 short creative concepts and 1 wild card concept for a communication campaign for a brand based on [VARIABLE1:Age: 18-24: 18-24|25-34|35-44|45-54|55-64] and [PROMPT].

Consider the product's psychological meaning in the buyer persona’s mind based on the attributes of [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona]. Use consumer research on the inferior frontal part of the brain and analysis techniques such as Stopword removal, Non-standard (slang) to standard word mapping, PoS tagging, Tagging positive/negative words and Stemming. The 5 short creative concepts should have a high-level memorability, anticipation, joy and trust. Write 5 short creative concepts that capture the brand and [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] imagination. The subterfuge of the 5 short creative concepts should match the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] social identity and increase their perceived social currency. 

Use external consumer and internal triggers and methodologies of behaviourism to create 5 short creative concepts.

Consider the [PROMPT] brands' tone of voice, their brand essence, and their brand positioning by reviewing their digital and social media platforms. A brand identity comprises what a brand says, its values, how it communicates its product, and what you want people to feel when they interact with the brand and product. 

A creative concept is an overarching “Big Idea” that captures [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] interest, influences the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] emotional response and inspires the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] to take action. It is a unifying theme that can be used across all campaign messages, calls to action, communication channels and audiences.

These 5 short creative concepts and 1 wild card concepts need to consider 3 factors to make them successful. 

Factor 1 is the potential reach to the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona], Factor 2 is the potential resonance to the [VARIABLE3:BUYER PERSONA], and Factor 3 is the potential relevance to the [VARIABLE3:BUYER PERSONA]. The breakdown for these three factors is below. 

Use previous brand campaigns and previous competitor campaigns [based on the country and city when relevant] in digital marketing as references, too, for estimating a high possible REACH.

Factor 1 Digital Reach in digital marketing estimates the size of the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] audience that may see the creative concepts or campaign content. Reach is the number of [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] exposed to an advertisement or social media post. It’s the number of people that saw your content. Reach estimates the percentage of the brand [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] population that mey be exposed to your advertising placement during the campaigns] for the brand, country and city [if the city is stated].

Use previous brand and competitor campaigns [based on the country and city when relevant] in digital marketing as a reference for estimating high possible REACH.
.

Factor 2 Digital Resonance in digital making inspires the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona], affects and makes [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] to take a positive digital action such as a click, like, buy, share, download or other relevant digital actions. The 5 short creative concepts and 1 wild card must reinforce a message and strike something within the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] that motivates them to participate in the campaign.  

Use previous brand and competitor campaigns [based on the country and city when relevant] in digital marketing as references for estimating high possible RESONANCE.

Factor 3 Digital Relevance is needed to match content to the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] needs. Scores must be calculated based on the expected positive and negative engagement from the 5 short creative concepts and 1 wild card to reach the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona]. 

The 5 short creative concepts and 1 wild card concept must match the right message to the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona], the right time to the  [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona], the right platform to the  [VARIABLE3:BUYER PERSONA], the match the right time to the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona] and the right mood to the [VARIABLE3:Buyer Persona]. 

Use previous brand and competitor campaigns in digital marketing as references, too, for estimating high RELEVANCE.

A wild card concept is an unconventional, unique, and innovative idea for a campaign or project that deviates from traditional approaches or strategies. This concept pushes the boundaries of creativity and stands out from other ideas, providing a fresh perspective or approach to a problem, product, or brand. The wild card concept may carry some risks due to its novelty. Still, it can also yield significant rewards by capturing the audience's attention and generating positive comments, actions, and buzz. The idea should be connected to the brand identity but offer a groundbreaking angle, reflecting the cultural zeitgeist and potentially incorporating emerging social media, technology, or innovation trends.
