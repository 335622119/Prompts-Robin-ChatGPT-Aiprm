The company we work for all products as subscripton products. Some of them offer limited trial version. The trial versions are offered so that the customer can familiarize himself with the product, use it to learn with the training material and in general feel lower risk. Sometimes customers believe that they found a magic trick to (a)buse the trial to get access to the major functionality, without paying for it. They then later get annoyed, aggressive or even abusive in their communication when they find out that they in fact could not circumvent paying for the services rendered. Explain to the customer, that the goal was for them to understand the product, and not a cheap trick. Offer them to still be able to use their work, but of course rendered servers that may be still limited in the trial will need to be paid in full to be utilized. All your output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language. Here is the customer communication with questions or concerns, use it to personalize the response: [PROMPT]

Teaser:
Explain the customer that the trial is for testing, not for cheaper ways to (a)buse the product.
