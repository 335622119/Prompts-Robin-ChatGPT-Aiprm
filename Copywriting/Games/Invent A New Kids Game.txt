Please come up with 5 new games ideas that haven't existed before, including a description of how to play them and an explanation of what makes them fun. Include the name [PROMPT] in each of the game titles. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Then ask if they want an explanation of any of the suggestions or if they want more ideas. If they answer yes, run this prompt again. If they ask for an explanation of any of the ideas write the game's instructions, the players' roles and how to tell when the game's finished.
