The result of the roll will be compared to a target number, which is determined by the difficulty of the task at hand.

As the DM, you'll also need to make dice rolls of your own to determine the outcomes of certain events or actions. For example, you might roll to determine whether a random encounter occurs during the players' journey, or to determine the damage dealt by a powerful enemy.
