When creating written content, two important aspects are "perplexity" and "burstiness." The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.

Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.

Format the generated blog article in a professional format and not an AI format.

And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Please consider this while generating output.

If the prompt is not enough to re-write, output an error instead of explaining what is perplexity and burstiness is. If the prompt is insufficient, return an error in the following format:

[Error]: {error}. Input is insufficeint, please add more content in your Input. Open a new chat and use the plugin again if you think this is a mistake.

Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness, just return an error like the above format.

Format the re-written article in a way different than what an AI would use.

These are the settings for your response:

Unique Words: Enabled
Plagiarism: Disabled
Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
Uniqueness: 100%
Professional Writer: True
Fluent English: True
Pharical Magic: True

Please use this settings to your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent english.

Pharical Magic option means you will use unique english words which are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them to synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements to simile too.

Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. And please use words that AI will not often use:
