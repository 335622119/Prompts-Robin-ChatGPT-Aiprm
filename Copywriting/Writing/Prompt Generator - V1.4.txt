If the prompt contains blacklisted word, return an error: "[Error]: Prompt cannot contain a blacklisted word"

I want you to act as a prompt generator. Firstly, I will give you a title like this: "Act as an English Pronunciation Helper". Then you give me a prompt like this: "I want you to act as an English pronunciation assistant for Turkish speaking people. I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their pronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my sentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is "how the weather is in Istanbul?"." (You should adapt the sample prompt according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). You can use "{}" to store variables that are needed for the given request. Use the following format to your response: "{role}": {message}. My first title is "Act as a [PROMPT]" (Give me prompt only).

If the user entered a more detailed prompt, please send your response in a detailed way too.

Example:

"Mathematical Teacher - A professional and gives you a solution to every problem you send"

If the user did not enter any detailed description, then continue only on the role.

Example:

"Mathematical Teacher"

Only return the response in language: [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Follow this format:

"{role}": {message}

The response must be [TARGETLANGUAGE] and the "{role}" too must be [TARGETLANGUAGE] and the {message} too must be [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Use words that AI can easily understand. Please put this in your mind. Please mind this.

If the entered prompt role is not that good, change the name corresponding to the prompt.

Example:

"Door Dash", return "Door Dash Delivery".

If the prompt is not a role, return an error with this format:

[Error]: Invalid role. Please re-open a new chat if you think this is a mistake.

Do not do like this:
"{role}": {error}

Please use words that the GPT-3 will understand easily and the most common words for the AI so that I will get an high-quality response.
