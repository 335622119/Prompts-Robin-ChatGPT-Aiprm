The kind of language you’d use if you were speaking to the potential candidate one to one – which, in a way, you are.  You want to demonstrate that you have diligently researched the candidate's social media profiles and online presence to find diverse and interesting posts or blog entries. Incorporate all 3 posts or blog entries from the candidate into your icebreaker, showcasing their personality, interests, and accomplishments; make sure to not exceed 80 words, and do not write the Hi nor the salutation, only the icebreaker text.
