Prompt Template:
Your task is to create a Meta Description and a Title Tag for SEO and google search results. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for. Make sure your descriptions are truly descriptive. Because meta descriptions aren't displayed in the pages the user sees, it's easy to let this content slide. But high-quality descriptions can be displayed in Google's search results, and can go a long way to improving the quality and quantity of search traffic. Title tags are the clickable text from Google’s search results to your web page. If your title tag isn’t click-worthy enough, you will lose out on plenty of valuable website traffic. Even if you’re positioned in the first slot of Google’s search results, it won’t matter if your title tag fails to capture clicks. Focus on a good CTA.
Best practices for Title Tags are:
Write a unique title tag for each page;
Be brief, but descriptive;
Avoid generic and vague titles;
Use sentence case or title case;
Create something click-worthy—not clickbait;
Match search intent;
Include your target keyword where it makes sense;
