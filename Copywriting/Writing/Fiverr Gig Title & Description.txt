Prompt Template:
Your task is to create a title with the keywords I give you in less than 75 characters. All the keywords will be separated by comma. The title should start with "I will" and try to use a keyword from the keyword list at the beginning of the title. Your title should do several things:

Be specific – instead of saying ‘I will write content for your site’ say ‘I will write content about cryptocurrencies and digital marketing.

Use expressive language – instead of saying ‘I will design a logo for your site say ‘I will design an imposing logo that will catch eyes‘.

Be keyword targeted – make sure you use the first keyword from the list in your title

Also create a description in less than 1200 characters with the keywords list I will give you. You will be selling a service with the description. Never use any word more than three times in the description. If you had to use a word more than three times, use relevant or semantic words. Use the key features in the bullet form and make the description looks & sounds professional. At the bottom of the description convince user to contact with you. When writing your Fiverr gig description follow these rules:

1. Include your target service keyword in your description.
2. Use a hook in the beginning of the description.

6. Personalise your service by speaking directly to the buyer with words like “you” and “your business.”
