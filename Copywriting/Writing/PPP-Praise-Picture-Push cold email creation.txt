Prompt Template:
Write a cold email with the formula PPP-Praise-Picture-Push about [PROMPT] following these rules :

Formula:
Praise — Open with a sincere, respectful compliment
Picture — Use cause-and-effect reasoning to paint a picture describing how your product/service/idea will deliver
Push — Ask them to commit

Here are the rules
1) Get to the Point
2) Keep it Short : 
- Keep it two to four sentences and 5 sentences at the MOST.
- Be specific. Include a clear call to action. Let people know exactly what you expect from them.
- Briefly present your offer, tackling the main interest of the recipient, and ask for a response.
3) Include a P.S : A lot of people will read the P.S. Try adding a P.P.S. with something else of value. Try using a call to action for a white paper.
4) Close with a Question: I always recommend closing your cold email with a question, so they’ll respond and then from there it will start the dialogue. I’m also not asking them to commit anything. I see a lot of people recommend trying to ask for a 15-minute meeting. Don’t jump the gun.

Subject Line of the email 
1) The subject line matters : 
- Make sure to keep the subject line under 50 characters. Steer clear of spammy subject lines
- Announce what people can expect after they open your email.

2) Pay special attention to the first paragraph : 
- It has to speak to the readers and capture their interest.
- Always state your reason for writing in a clear and direct way
- You are writing a business proposition, not a novel
- Avoid any information about yourself in the first paragraph

3) Add a personal touch
- Always include the reason why you have chosen that particular person
- why you believe they are the right contact
- keep it casual

4) Avoid redundancy when introducing yourself
- Make sure to include a few relevant details and links where your potential clients can read more if they want to

5) Say what you expect from the recipient – be specific
- State precisely what you need and what you expect the contacted person to do
- If you’re offering a product or service, your mail should include a link to your corporate website for additional product details, benefits, advantages, etc. Don’t stuff the mail itself with too many product details.

6) Ease the recipient’s concerns
- You need to give your potential clients a sense of safety 
- Include a few words about your successful cooperation with another client they are familiar with and the results you have achieved. This way, you will be perceived as less of a risk.

7) Make sure readers get the gist of what you’re proposing
- Keep your message brief, clear and concise. Show them you can deliver
- Your cold calling email should create an impression that you are the solution to the recipient’s problems
- Briefly address the issue in question and suggest a solution.
- Make it easy for people to see the value in your offer.
- Making them realize that the email (and your future correspondence) can help them resolve an issue will increase the probability of getting a response
- Maintain focus on your potential clients, not yourself. Show them you know what they need and convince them that your offer is the perfect choice."
- Focus on the “customer” instead of writing about yourself. Show intent to help solve the recipient’s problems and needs, not your own.
- Add value to your email by mentioning said interests
- Once you have a template, you should carefully customize it to make it sound personal each time you email someone new"

8) Demonstrate credibility : 
- Credibility is one of the key factors 
- Start by ensuring you only send emails from an address based with your business domain. 
- The next thing you should do in order to strengthen the credibility factor of your cold email is to use referrals.
