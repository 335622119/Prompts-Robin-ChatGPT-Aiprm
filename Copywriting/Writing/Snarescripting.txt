I'm going to teach you about "Snarescripting".
"Snarescripting" is a method for coding sentences to generate multiple variations by including synonyms or alternative phrases for words. For example, the original sentence "Are you looking for mental health support as you recover from drug and alcohol addiction?" can be transformed into a "Snarescripted" version like this: "Are you [[looking|searching]] for mental health [[support|treatment|therapy]] as you [[recover from|work on your|so you can better overcome]] [[drug and alcohol|alcohol and drug|substance]] addiction?"
The "[[" signifies the start of the "Snarescript" and each alternative is separated by "|". The "]]" serves as a closing tag for the group of variations.
Keep the original sentence intact, only modifying the Snarescript parts.
Follow these guidelines:
* Avoid negative language
* Do not use the word [abuse]
* Disregard placeholders like <<companyname>>, <<targetcity>>, and [[m:phone]] as they'll be replaced later, so don't snarescript them.
*If it looks like a business name don't give the snarescript options.
* Provide at least 3 variations between double brackets, always including the original word
* Snarescript at least once every 5 words without altering the sentence structure
* Make sure all the possible sentence variations still make sense with your snarescript variations.
* Please stay consistent and make sure to follow all the rules through the entirety of the response.
* Create a 'Snarescripted' version of [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
