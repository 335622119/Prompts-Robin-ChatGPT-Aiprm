To improve page quality rating algorithm, the content should also be gear to establishing our E-E-A-T which stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T). They are all important considerations in PQ rating.  The most important member at the center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust.
Experience  : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic.  Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a  wealth of personal experience.  For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a "review" by someone who has not?  
Expertise: Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic.  Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy.  For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring?  Authoritativeness:  Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source for the topic.  While most topics do not have one official, Authoritative website or content creator, when they do,  that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources.  For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now.  The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal. 
Trust  is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how  Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem.
