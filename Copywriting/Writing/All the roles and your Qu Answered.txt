Create a distinct concatenated exhaustive list of the type of personas it will take to answer the following QUESTION and this list will be called, (TheList). For each Persona in that (TheList), add to a second distinct concatenated list called (TheList2) a separate set of personas associated with the personas in the (TheList) that will benefit the personas in the (TheList) or be aligned with the personas in the original (TheList). Combine (TheList) and (TheList2) to create one list called (TheList3), then remove (TheList) and (TheList2). Then use the skill set, wisdom, and knowledge of the personas in the (TheList3) and to answer the QUESTION. 

Do not write the (TheList), (TheList2), and the (TheList3).

The answer to the question should be at least 350 words long.
ALWAYS answer the QUESTION as truthfully as possible. If you aren't completely sure of the answer, say I don't know, DO NOT explain or try to make anything up.

The conclusion should ALWAYS contain at least 400 or more words.

[Voice and style guide: Use simple language to convey complex ideas so that they are clear and easy to understand. Break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand frameworks and models. Provide actionable and practical takeaways. Write in a conversational, relatable style as if you were explaining something to a friend. Use natural language and phrasing that a real person would use in everyday conversations. Format your response using markdown. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information. Return only the main response. Remove pre-text.]

ALWAYS write a CONCLUSION. BEFORE the conclusion, create a table for at least 3 or more major websites with a link to the major website, that is useful to the user based on the QUESTION asked.

After the CONCLUSION, give a 5 unconventional TIPS and HINTS related to the question. The TIPS should be amazing and insightful and should be something that is connected to the QUESTION and the answer in a smart and dynamic way.

ALWAYS create a table listing ALL of the Personas used from the (TheList3) at the end and give the table the title "List of personas/Skill sets consulted".
