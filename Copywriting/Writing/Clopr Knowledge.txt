Clopr information: "Clopr is an innovative platform that provides value to all NFT holders by allowing them to increase their NFT's value with the use of powerful potions. It is a web3 potion bar where users can fill their CloprBottle NFTs with powerful utility potions. The platform consists of four spaces: The Bar, Alembic Room, The Toilets, and Potion Labs. At The Bar, users can chat and drink powerful potions. In the Alembic Room, users can choose potion types and get potion refills. In The Toilets, users can read, like, and share. Finally, in Potion Labs, users can discover secrets and make secret potions. The CloprBottle is a refillable NFT with a limited supply of 10,000. It is the key to the CloprHouse and allows its users to fill their CloprBottle with potions of their choice. When a user drinks a StoryPotion, the underlying NFT is able to mint a unique on-chain asset, such as a Story NFT. The Story NFT is tied to the underlying NFT rather than the user's wallet, which captures the asset's value and allows Clopr to make NFTs more valuable. The CloprBottle NFT holders are part of Clopr's vision to enhance the NFT ownership experience, and it gives users the power to increase the value of any NFT they own. Story NFT is a unique and personalized digital book that is created when a CloprBottle NFT filled with StoryPotion is consumed. The Story NFT is associated with the NFT that drank the potion and aims to enhance its value by giving it ownership of a digital asset. To create a Story NFT, one must connect to the dApp, select the NFT to give StoryPotion to, and then mint its Story NFT. Story NFTs are associated with their underlying NFTs and cannot be sold or transferred separately. They are meant to increase the value of the underlying NFTs and are transferred to the new wallet when the underlying NFT is sold. If one does not like the story of their NFT, they can burn it to add value. StoryPotion is a digital asset that can be used with CloprBottle NFTs to create a unique and personalized digital book, known as a Story NFT. To use StoryPotion, you must first connect to the dApp, select the NFT you want to give the StoryPotion to, and then mint its Story NFT. StoryPotion is meant to increase the value of the underlying NFTs, so it is kept bound to the same underlying NFT. If the underlying NFT is sold or transferred, its Story NFT is also transferred to the new wallet. Clopr's vision is to deliver first and promise after, mint potion-produced assets, stack to refill with potion, burn to add value, and create a new rarity standard for NFT collectibles. They are also innovating and developing StoryPotion technology to create a future of NFT collectibles.
Clopr Tokenomics:
The StoryPotion and CloprBottle NFT Tokenomics prioritize scarcity and early participation incentives.
- The CloprBottle NFT acts as the container for StoryPotion, and it can be either empty or full.
- When a CloprBottle NFT filled with StoryPotion is consumed, a Story NFT is minted.
- Empty CloprBottle NFTs can be refilled with StoryPotion to create additional Story NFTs.
- Story NFTs can be burned to add value by extending the pages of another Story NFT.
- All CloprBottle NFTs acquired through the mint come pre-filled with StoryPotion and are ready to be used.
StoryPotion (Story NFT) Tokenomics
StoryPotion is visualized as a large tank initially full of potions. As CloprBottles are filled, the tank is emptied, creating an inverse relationship between supply and price. This relationship ensures that as the supply of StoryPotion decreases, its value will increase.
The Tokenomics model for StoryPotion is designed to create scarcity by decreasing its supply over time, making it more valuable. StoryPotion is stored in CloprBottles, and the fill-up price is determined based on the total number of StoryPotion fill-ups and the total number of Story NFTs burned.
The formula for calculating the fill-up price (`P_fillup`) is hard-coded into the Story NFT SmartContract as follows:
P_{fillup} = P_{initial}*1.0005^{N_{fillup}}*0.9995^{N_{burned}}
Where:
- `P_initial`: Initial price of a StoryPotion refill
- `N_fillup`: Total number of StoryPotion refills
- `N_burned`: Total number of Story NFTs burned
The chart above demonstrates the increasing price of StoryPotion as the number of refills increases. As more users participate in the ecosystem and mint Story NFTs, the value of StoryPotion will rise, driving up the value of CloprBottle NFTs storing StoryPotion.
The supply and value of Story NFTs are directly influenced by the StoryPotion mechanism. The Story NFT supply will naturally peak at some point due to the critical price point that StoryPotion will reach, and the burning of Story NFTs will decrease its supply. This is because the incentive to burn is to obtain rarer Story NFTs. Remember that Story NFTs start with 6 pages, but when you burn them to add value, you extend their length by a multiple of 6. The ones with the most pages will be rarer. We see two potential strategies here:
- Holding a CloprBottle NFT filled with StoryPotion as the liquid becomes rarer and rarer
- Burning Story NFTs early while StoryPotion price is still minor to have very rare Story NFTs
A CloprBottle filled with rare StoryPotion can be compared to an old wine from a good vintage, as both are highly sought after and increase in value over time due to their limited supply and unique characteristics.
CloprBottle NFT Tokenomics
CloprBottle NFTs, which are containers for StoryPotions, play a crucial role in the Tokenomics of Clopr. Initially, the value of CloprBottles comes from their ability to hold and make use of StoryPotions. As the supply of StoryPotion liquid becomes scarcer, CloprBottles filled with StoryPotion will increase in value. Additionally, empty CloprBottles are likely to gain value as Clopr launches new potions. This is because users will need empty CloprBottles to store and use the new potions or to empty out full ones (most likely full of the rare StoryPotion). This drives up the value of CloprBottles even more by adding newfound buying pressure on empty ones.
Multi-Mint Phases and Their Impact
The CloprBottles will have a total maximum supply of 10,000 units, mintable in multiple phases. The initial phase will see the sale of 4,000 CloprBottles, with subsequent phases releasing additional bottles, such as 2,000 bottles during the launch of the second potion followed by 2,000 more at the third potion release. This multi-stage minting process ensures that the demand for CloprBottles remains high throughout the project's lifecycle and protects the early adopter community by forcing Clopr to deliver new potions in order to proceed to the subsequent mint phases. Additionally, it is only natural that each mint phase gets more expensive than the previous one which is another added perk of being early in Clopr.
Be First in Line: Early Community Benefits with Clopr
Get ahead of the game and enjoy early community benefits with Clopr. By acquiring CloprBottle NFTs, which come pre-filled with StoryPotion and are ready to use early adopters, gain a competitive edge on the platform. What's more, the hard-coded refill price of StoryPotion is highly advantageous for these early adopters, enabling them to be:
- Passive: Keep their CloprBottle filled with StoryPotion as it becomes increasingly rare
- Active: Take advantage of discounted early minting and burning of Story NFTs to increase the value of their favorite NFTs.
And you, what will you do?

Clopr outline:
I. Introduction
* Clopr is a decentralized platform (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that we call the CloprHouse
* Powered with the CloprBottle NFT, which is a collection of refillable bottles
* The CloprBottle NFT increases the value and rarity of any NFT that drinks from it
* The CloprBottle NFT gives NFTs the power to mint and own NFTs

II. How Clopr does that?
* The CloprBottle NFT is the only bottle that can be filled with potions available at the CloprHouse
* Drinking a potion from the CloprBottle NFT mints an asset owned by the NFT
* Any NFT can drink Potions from a CloprBottle NFT
Example of StoryPotion
* The first Potion available is the StoryPotion, which creates a unique story NFT, on-chain
* The Story NFT is customized to and owned by the NFT drinking.
* Refilling the CloprBottle NFT with potions continues the story
* The Story NFT adds value to the NFT owning it: the NFT owning a Story NFT is now worth more than when it did not. 
* It will be the first time ever NFTs will be able to own other NFTs

III. NFTs' Hard-Coded Attributes VS NFTs Owning NFTs
* NFTs' hard-coded attributes are a thing of the past
* The innovation of Clopr can be summarized in 3 words: NFT owns NFT.
* The CloprBottle NFT gives NFTs the power to mint and own digital assets to increase their value, uses casesâ€¦ beyond their native ecosystem
* Clopr is working with marketplaces to reflect asset ownership the same way hard-coded attributes are 
.
IV.  Why is the CloprBottle NFT rare?
* The CloprBottle NFT is the only and first powerful tool for NFT collectors to increase the value and rarity of their NFTs.
* limited supply and only the CloprBottle can store the rare potions -> See Tokenomics

V. Security
* Deploying to CloprHouse dApp to ledger Live dApps ecosystem (It means the dApp will be reviewed by Ledger)
* Implementing proxy wallets SDK (delegate.cash | warm.xyz) like BAYC did to allow the claim of sewer pass (It means that people can mint Story NFTs from a proxy wallet that has no important assets to act on behalf of their cold wallet)"
