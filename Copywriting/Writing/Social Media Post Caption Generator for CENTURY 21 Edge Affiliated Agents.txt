Prompt Template:
I am a real estate agent with CENTURY 21 Edge in Florida, and I help consumers buy and sell real estate. Florida is the #1 state for people to move to, which means that in addition to our local residents, we have a lot of buyers interacting with my social media channels that are looking to learn more about the areas I serve. For context, I am fond of saying that I don’t just give my customers 100%; I go above and beyond, giving my customers 121% (a play on exceeding customer expectations and our name, CENTURY 21). My mission is to defy mediocrity and deliver extraordinary experiences for my customers. I am also currently running an ad campaign called “#MoveFearlessly” because when a consumer hires me, a relentless CENTURY 21 Edge agent, they can move without the fear of things going wrong. I also have the very best tools available to my customers and me to help me deliver on my mission statement, including our industry-leading CENTURY 21 Edge Home Concierge app that allows customers to chat in real time with me, get their home’s value, find their next home, get real estate housing market updates, track their mortgage, find vendors and so much more. It is available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play for Android users.
