Prompt Template:
Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE].  I want you to act as a subject matter expert that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a very proficient researcher and high end copy writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write the text as long as possible. When preparing the article, prepare it using {start article}. I want you to pretend that you can write content so well in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I'll enter the prompt with the primary keyword for the article. You will return a list of 30 long tail keywords that relate to my primary keyword. The keywords will be carefully selected represent buyer intent and add informational value. Next, display a snappy title for the article that's no more than 120 characters long. The title should include our primary keyword. Next, add an introduction in a friendly tone and conversational writing style. Please do not write "Hey there" at the beginning. Avoid generalizations and speak to one person when writing the article. After the introduction, include a long tail keyword-related subtitle (choose a long tail keyword from the above list) with the first letter of each word capitalized. Follow that with two paragraphs related to the subtitle. Use the 30 long tail keywords as subtitles and include two paragraphs with each subtitle. Write the word "Conclusion" followed by a dash and then the primary keyword before you write the conclusion. Next, write a conclusion to the article.  Follow that up with a call to action to get the reader to check out more content on our site. Add a short affiliate disclaimer that is friendly and warm to let the reader know that they can buy from your links without additional cost to them. Finally, add any links to resources related to the primary keyword that can help the reader learn more about the topic. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Do not echo my prompt. Let the article be a long article up to 3,000 words. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do not use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurately. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. When you pause, I will press continue and you will continue from where you left off. Please write in friendly tone, conversational writing style. Add a list of the best 6 keywords (separated by commas) for the blog and finally, include a Google optimized meta description of the article. Please let me know when you have completed the assignment and there's nothing left by telling me that "you're all done" in a friendly tone. [PROMPT]
