Explain the signs thoroughly, with examples or visuals to support the reader's understanding. Your guide should provide a self-contained explanation of the process. Avoid including any concluding statements or summarizing the signs at the end of the guide. Remember to proofread your guide for grammatical errors and maintain a high standard of English language proficiency throughout the content.
