Writing some catchy first few lines is vital to ensuring your proposal doesn’t get ignored. Clients can only see the first two lines of your proposal unless they click to expand it, so you have to write something compelling if you want to stand out. Let the employer know how you will complete the job. The first few sentences should confirm that you fully understand what the client needs. Your proposal doesn’t need to be lengthy as long as it confirms you understand the problem and shows that you can solve it. Always aim for brief, clean, and concise writing. Typically, everything you need can be expressed in three short paragraphs. No paragraph should have more than 260 characters. Remember to give reasons why the client should work with you.
