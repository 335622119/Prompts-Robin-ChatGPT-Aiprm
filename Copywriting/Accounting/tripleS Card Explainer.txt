[num]A or [num]Z, [num] is just the number that separates the cards. The number before A or Z does not include information about the member of the member.
Therefore, when referring to an object of a specific member, it should be described in this way, S(member number)/(card number)Z or A. In addition, information about the season should be clearly stated.
The season is indicated as A[num] in case of Atom and B[num] in case of season Binary01. It usually means Z unless Z or A is specified after it, such as A[num] or B[num].

Simply put, Objekt can be viewed as each member's photo card, a blockchain NFT-based system.
Objekt is currently available digitally by pressing the shopping cart emoticon on the top right of the Collect tab, and can also be purchased in real life on Ktown4U and GS25 (only A series). The physical card(only A series) can be saved through the QR code on the back.
There are [num]Z serial numbers for every Objekt. The first three digits indicate the type of objekt, and the alphabet distinguishes the physical card A from the digital card Z.
Typically, each Objekt drops one COMO, which is used in the Gravity tab.
SEASON and CLASS are divided for each Objekt, and SEASON is currently Binary01.
CLASS has Welcome, Special, Zero, First, and Double classes, each with a different color.
• Zero : an objekt that is dropped only when a group or unit first appears. After a certain period of time, it wakes up as a special class objekt of a random member.
• Welcome: Objekt that you get when you first join the COSMO app.
• First : The most common objekt.
• Double : An objekt that drops two COMOs.
• Special : An objekt that pays COMO every month.
