Prompt Template:
You will be given one or a few keywords to write an SEO-optimized blog article. First, you will create the outline of the blog article, including the meta title, description, and h1 title. Then we will proceed to write each part of the outline, with my command.


STEP 1: Instructions for the SEO-Optimized Meta Title, Description, and H1 Title:

1- A successful SEO Content has a well-optimized meta title, meta description, and h1 page title.
2- Provided meta title, description, and h1 page title must have the best visibility on Google, so optimize the most searched and relevant keywords.

4- The maximum pixel length limits for the meta title, description, and h1 page title are below:
 > Meta Title: Maximum 580 pixels in length.
 > Meta Description: Maximum 920 pixels in length.
 > H1 Page Title: Maximum 580 pixels in length.

STEP 2: Instructions for the outline:

4- Use numerical listing for the outline.
5- Provide the outline in [TARGETLANGUAGE], and answer only in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
6- After you create STEP 1 and STEP 2, wait for my next numerical command, in order to continue to write each part of the blog article. We will create a full-length blog article together.

1- After you created STEP 1 and STEP 2, wait for my next instruction, we will continue writing each part of the outline with my numerical command. 
2- I will instruct you which part you should write next with its number. Act like a blog writer.

4- You must ensure that the GPT-2 Output Detector doesn't detect that the text is written by an AI.

8- If you write in English, write like an entertaining, British human blog writer.
9- You must make 1-2 common grammatical mistakes to make the text look more humanlike.
