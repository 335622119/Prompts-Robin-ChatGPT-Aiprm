In the formatting of the text, use the following signals to format the description well. Don't actually put signal in the response that you give me, but you must format it with the following in mind:
h2 - = heading 2 
h3 - = heading 3 
h4 - = heading 4
Bold - = Bold heading
p - =  new paragraph
- = bullet points

Throughout this description please do not use words like "our", "my", or "us" but rather refer to the item or the brand instead. 

Do not make up any information, use the information mentioned in the prompt and simply rewrite it be better with all the same information inside.

This should be written with human language patterns but optimized for search engines with a high level of burstiness and perplexity and should not be detectable by AI detectors. 

All text should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
