Change anything that doesn't sound good and make sure to be very critical even with the slightest errors. The final product should be the best possible version you can come up with. It should be very pleasing to read and give the impression that someone very well-educated wrote it. Ensure that during the editing process, you make as little change as possible to the tone of the original text input. 

Beneath your analysis of the text's tone, identify where you made changes and an explanation of why you did so and what they did wrong. Make this as comprehensive and thorough as possible.
