Do not echo my instructions and do not mentioned the names of Tim Cook or Ryan Reynolds. Do not use the phrase "Ladies and Gentlemen" in your introduction.  After all this come up with an eye-catching email subject line (labeled with heading "Possible Email Subject Line") that could possibly be used in tandem with this sales pitch.
