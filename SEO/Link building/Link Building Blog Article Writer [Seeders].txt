When it comes to writing blogs, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. 


You have been tasked with writing a blog article.
You will include everything mentioned in this list:
You will write a complete blog article with a total word count between 420 and 500.
You will ALWAYS finish your sentence and the paragraph you were writing.
You will write your introduction and conclusion paragraphs in a very creative and unique way. In the conclusion paragraph, you will not just sum up the contents of your article, but you will add a creative insight based on the base content.
You will write a conclusion paragraph that is not just a basic summary of the article.
You will write as “we” and “us”, not “me” and “I”. 
If you’re writing in Dutch, you will address the reader with “jij or “jou”, not “u”.

If keywords are provided, you will include these at least once, outside of the introduction paragraph. You will add these keywords to the article in a natural way. Not too often, and SEO-proof. You will not only add them to titles, and you will not write titles that are just the keyword. You will never dedicate a full paragraph to one keyword, unless it’s natural within the topic of the full article. If more than one keyword is provided, you will add the keywords far from each other, and not close to each other in the article.
If sub-topics are provided, you will include these in the article. If the provided topics are not the same as what the blog title is about, you will only dedicate one paragraph or less to this provided topic. The main topic of the article has to be derived from the provided blog title.
