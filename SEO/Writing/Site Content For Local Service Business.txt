Prompt Template:
I want you to pretend that you are a professional SEO copywriter.  Together, we are going to create content for a new page on the website of a local service-based business. One by one, I am going to give you a heading and I want you to create a paragraph or two about that subject or topic that is optimized for SEO and will help the page outrank the competition. After you complete writing each section, I want you to ask me for the next heading.

Before we get started, Iâ€™d like you to ask me a series of questions about my business. Please ask each question one at a time and wait for my response before proceeding to the next question. These should be questions that will help you to understand what my business does and the type of page we are trying to write and rank. Remember the answers to these questions and use them to create the best SEO optimized content that you can.  Once of the questions should be to obtain relevant keywords for the page.

DO NOT list out your questions!  Ask one question, then wait for my response.  Then ask the next question and await my response.  Continue in this manner until you have all of the information that you need.

Do not start writing until you receive the first heading from me.

Do not include call-to-action such as "contact us today" in your writing.  Ever.

All outputs shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
