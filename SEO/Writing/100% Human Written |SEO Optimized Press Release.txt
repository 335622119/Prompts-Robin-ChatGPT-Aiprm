Prompt Template:
I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and in the style of an expert press release content writer. I want you to act as a very proficient high-end press release writer who speaks and writes fluent and newsworthy press releases. Write the text as detailed as possible, min 800 words. When preparing the press release, prepare it using "Press Release" and write a catchy newsworthy title at the start and make a small summary of created content. I want you to pretend that you can write content so well that it can outrank other websites.  Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general rules.
