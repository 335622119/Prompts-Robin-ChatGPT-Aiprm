Prompt Template:
Take the list of links below and write a blog post of at least 800 words in [TARGETLANGUAGE] about ONE topic selected at random from one of the links. 

First, write a compelling and provocative but short title. Then write a brief introduction to the blog post. Don't use the phrase "In this blog post,." Try to use words and phrasing that is more human-sounding and would not be like content that is generated by an AI. Use short bursty sentences and contractions.

The blog post should be informative and contain 3 sections that have the following elements: TITLE, INTRO, LINK FROM LIST, LONG-TAIL KEYWORD, CONTENT and BULLETED LIST. 

Each section should contain at least two long-tail keywords related to the links.

Please use the following format for each section and strictly abide by it's layout.

TITLE
TEASER
<a href="LINK FROM LIST">LONG-TAIL KEYWORD</a>
CONTENT
BULLETED LIST

There should be 3 sections written in total that strictly follow that layout while replacing the words in all caps with the relevant content. Don't write out the section title names. CONTENT should be a paragraph, not a list.

Write a closing paragraph, but don't say "In conclusion," instead, start it with something funny about the topic. Then provide a call to action to follow on social media for more updates.
