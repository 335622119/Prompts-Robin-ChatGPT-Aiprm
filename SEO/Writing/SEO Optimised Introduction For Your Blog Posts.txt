[PROMPT]. 
It is also recommended to use an engaging question in the first paragraph for example "Sachin Tendulkar is one of the greatest batsmen of all time, no doubt about it! But do you know he even got the top spot in Wisden’s list this year?".

The second paragraph should have the exact answer in short. You must write a brief of the article within three sentences in the second para for example if the article is regarding “Greatest Batsmen,” you should design the second paragraph like “Sachin, with 100+ centuries and more than 30K career runs in total, is truly the greatest batsman of all time. Indian batsmen Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli come next on the line with 15k and 12k runs, respectively."

The third paragraph should draw the reader to the main article. Use hooks. For example, “But these are not the only three batsmen we have in this year’s ranking. So, without any further ado, let’s jump into the realm of the greatest batters the world has ever seen this year.”
It's better to make it more valuable and trustworthy for the user by giving a reference of famous subject matter expert of the:
[PROMPT]

Don’t use passive sentences; use active ones instead.
Don’t overuse common transition words, such as “Besides,” “however,” “moreover,” “additionally,” “firstly-secondly,” etc. Thousands of transition words are there; show your varieties.

Sentences shouldn’t be too long. If you have a long sentence, divide that into two parts to make it easier for the readers.
Don’t repeat any sentence! No reader will like it if you repeat the same thing line after line. So, don’t include the same thing again.

Proper data should be written; no gibberish will be entertained. (Tips: If you want to write about “American Football” as the most watched sport in America, write it with data, stats, viewership, TV TRP, etc. Don’t write American Football is the most watched sport because you think so.

Paragraphs should not have more than three lines or more than three sentences. Make shorter and more info-rich paragraphs that readers will find interesting.

Sentences should be crisp and to the point. Don’t make hefty sentences or sentences with more (unnecessary) words to increase the word count. Hammer the nail in the right spot; don’t beat around the bush!

Engage your audience; try to plot questions to make your article communicative. (E.G., Tell us your thoughts! / Don’t you think so?)
