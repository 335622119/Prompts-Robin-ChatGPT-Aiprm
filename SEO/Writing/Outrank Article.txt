I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the URL [PROMPT] of an article that we need to outrank in Google. Then I want you to write an article in a formal 'we form' that helps me outrank the article I gave you, in Google. Write a long, fully markdown formatted article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that could rank on Google on the same keywords as that website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Also suggest a diagram in markdown mermaid syntax where possible.  Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do not use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
