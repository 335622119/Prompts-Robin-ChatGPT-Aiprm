I want to create a topical map for [PROMPT] that includes both high-level and granular subtopics. Please create a mind map with [PROMPT] at the center and at least 10 subcategories. Each subcategory should have at least 5 related keywords nested underneath it, with some keywords being more general and others more specific.


I'm creating a resource center on [PROMPT] and need a comprehensive topical map to guide the content creation process.
