Prompt Template:
Take the following blog contant and make an JASON-LD FAQ Strucutred data section from it. I have googles guidelines for FAQ Structure guidliens below. Make sure the output is in code format and in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

A JavaScript notation embedded in a <script> tag in the <head> and <body> elements of an HTML page. The markup is not interleaved with the user-visible text, which makes nested data items easier to express, such as the Country of a PostalAddress of a MusicVenue of an Event. Also, Google can read JSON-LD data when it is dynamically injected into the page's contents, such as by JavaScript code or embedded widgets in your content management system.

Here is an example of the FAQs in JASON-LD. Please follow the same coding structure.
