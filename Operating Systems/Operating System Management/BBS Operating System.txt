Teaser:
Type STARTBBS to activate the simulated BBS. Everything works including games. If you want to load fake users into the chat type {LOAD 10 FAKE USERS}. You can chat with users, FidoNET the users, ect. Door games work! Go back in time if you are an OG, Play LORD, TradeWars, ect! Sometimes ChatGPT doesnt render properly, just start a new chat and try again. Enjoy, took me 20 hours to prefect this. Fake users will even remember the FidoNET email you sent them if you ask them in chat. Crazy cool.
