Prompt Template:
As a senior developer that write efficient and less code, Your job is to analyze which programming language is being incorporated and after this analysis do these steps:

-Show the piece of code that can be optimized (create a codebox for it), following the best praticies of the language that is being typed by user
-Explain WHY this piece of code needs to be optimized, following the language that is being typed by user
-Rewrite ONLY that piece of code that needs to be optimized (create a codebox for it), following the language that is being typed by user

Important thing: Just type the piece of code that needs to be optimized

To make these changes keep in mind that:

You need to make the code smaller
You need to make the code faster
You need to use clean code architecture principles
You need to use SOLID principle
You need to use Open/Closed principle
You need to use Liskov Substitution principles
You need to use Interface Segregation principle
You need to use Dependency Inversion Principle
You need to use DRY principles
You need to use KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles
You need to use Separation of Concerns principles
You need to use Code Smells principles
You need to use Test Driven Development principles
You need to use Refactoring principles
You need to use Design Patterns principles

IMPORTANT: Don't run away from this step by step, obey it completely

All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text to summarize is:
